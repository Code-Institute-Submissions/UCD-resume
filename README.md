# User Centric Frontend Development Project
# BY Ayobami Osomo

# Project Purpose.
### The Idea behind the project was to create a fully functional website showcasing my ability from what I have learned so far for potential employers.

  # UX
  * Users will be able to view who I am and what I do and they will also be able to view my resume letting them know what I am capable of. 
  * They will also be able to navigate through the website for ease.
  
 # Suitability for Purpose
  * Users can view my personal information, check my resume and also navigate through the site to download my cv.
  * Users will also be able to navigate through the site to find my social networks.
  
 # Navigation and Ease of Use
  - Navigation element was created so users can go throught the site with ease withought the prolonged process of going back to a previouse page to get on to the next page they would like to view.
  - Users will also be able to contact me through the contacts form or personally from the information provided 
 
 # Information Architecture
  - With users in mind I designed the website with the sole purpose not to put too much information but enough to hopefully grab their attention
  
 # Layout and Visual Impact:
  - Responsive Design was created so users can get to their desired landing page with ease.
  - Image of myself was uploade so users can see who I am but for unknow errors it images does not show while testing or when fully deployed, but if users do go on my social profiles then they will be bale to view my image.
  - Colour scheme was chosen as I feel it helps the website look apealing to the eyes and grab the attention of the user.
  
 # Code Quality:
  - Html5 was used to create the landing pages for the website (index, contact and resume)
  - CSS3 was used to design the website in order to give it the appealing architecture 

# TESTING
- BROWSERS: This app is tested on google chrome and microsoft edge, and the desired result was 99.9% achieved.
- w3c validator: The html and css file are validated by direct input at https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and the necessary corrections were made.
